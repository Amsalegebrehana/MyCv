                <div class="text">
                    Using relative size on styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive yes 
                    it matters.  Of course there is some debate among web designers, however my opinion is as follow.
                    Any sizing that should scale depending on the font-size of an element other than the root. Mostly 
                    the only reason we use (em) units is to scale up an element which has non default font sizing. And 
                    any sizing that does not need (em) units can be done using (rem) units such as font sizing because 
                    it’s more manageable. Importantly, to create a uniform scalable design, our media queries should 
                    also be in relative sizing units. This will ensure that whatever user browser font sizes, 
                    your media queries will respond to it and adjust your layout.
                    <br> Zooming effect using (rem) units, if the user increases their font size the integrity of 
                    the layout will be preserved, and the text won’t get squashed up in a rigid space meant for smaller 
                    text. And if the user decreases their font size, the entire layout scales down, and they won’t be 
                    left with a tiny smattering of text in a wasteland of white space. 
                    Use relative size like (%) not (em or rem) for column widths in a layout so they can fluidly 
                    fit unpredictably sized viewpoints. However to keep the column flexible and scalable, single 
                    column should still generally incorporate (rem) values.
                    <br> Generally using relative size units gives us flexibility in our designs, and the ablity 
                    to scale elements up and down, instead of being stuck with fixed sizes. And it allow browser users 
                    to control the overall scale of sites for maximum readability.
