                        When we say 200px we’re actually telling the browser to change the default font size from the 16px and 
                        it’s going to interpret that as overriding its default. So the rest of the elements are going 
                        to inherit from the given size instead of the original default font size of the browser.

            <h2 id="htwo">Why we use relative size units</h2>
      
      <article>
            <p>
                <div class="text">
                    Using relative size on styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive yes 
                    it matters.  Of course there is some debate among web designers, however my opinion is as follow.
                    Any sizing that should scale depending on the font-size of an element other than the root. Mostly 
                    the only reason we use (em) units is to scale up an element which has non default font sizing. And 
                    any sizing that does not need (em) units can be done using (rem) units such as font sizing because 
                    it’s more manageable. Importantly, to create a uniform scalable design, our media queries should 
                    also be in relative sizing units. This will ensure that whatever user browser font sizes, 
                    your media queries will respond to it and adjust your layout.
                    <br> Zooming effect using (rem) units, if the user increases their font size the integrity of 
                    the layout will be preserved, and the text won’t get squashed up in a rigid space meant for smaller 
                    text. And if the user decreases their font size, the entire layout scales down, and they won’t be 
                    left with a tiny smattering of text in a wasteland of white space. 
                    Use relative size like (%) not (em or rem) for column widths in a layout so they can fluidly 
                    fit unpredictably sized viewpoints. However to keep the column flexible and scalable, single 
                    column should still generally incorporate (rem) values.
                    <br> Generally using relative size units gives us flexibility in our designs, and the ablity 
                    to scale elements up and down, instead of being stuck with fixed sizes. And it allow browser users 
                    to control the overall scale of sites for maximum readability.

        <h2 id="htwo">CSS3 New Features</h2>
  
  <article>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a simple mechanism for adding style(e.g, fonts, colors, spacing) to web documents. <br>
            CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extendind CSS2.1.It brings a lot of new features.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>These specific changes are</strong>  <br>
            <div class="text">
                1.	CSS3 Selectors <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; This selectors can target almost any element on the page with wide range of selectors.
                Three more attribute selectors were added in CSS3; they allow for &nbsp;&nbsp;substring selection like pseudo-class selector. <br>
                2.	CSS3 Colors <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;It supports some new ways of describing colors. Means we can declare colors in addition to hexadecimal formats 
                such us rgb() notation, providing either integer &nbsp;&nbsp;(0-255) or percentages and the name of the color itself. 
                CSS3 provides us with opacity property. Opacity sets the opaqueness of the element on which it’s &nbsp;&nbsp;decleared, 
                similar to alpha. <br>
                3.	Rounded Corners <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;The border radius property lets users create rounded corners without the need for images or additional markup. <br>
                4.	Drop Shadows <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;CSS3 provides the ability to add drop shadows to elements using the box-shadow property. This property lets you specify 
                the color, height, width, blur, and offset &nbsp;&nbsp;of one or multiple inner and/or outer drop shadows on your elements. <br>
                5.	Text Shadow <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Text-shadow adds shadows to individual characters in text node. Priors to CSS3, his would be done by either using an 
                image or duplicating a text element and &nbsp;&nbsp;then positioning it. <br>
                6.	Linear Gradients <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;W3C added the syntax for generating linear gradients with CSS3. <br>
                7.	Radial Gradients <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Radial Gradients are circular or elliptical gradients. Rather than proceeding along a straight axis, colors 
                blend out from a starting point in all directions. <br>
                8.	Multiple Background Images <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;In CSS3, there’s no need to include an element for every background image; it provides us with the ability 
                to add more than one background image to any &nbsp;&nbsp;element, even to pseudo-elements. <br>
